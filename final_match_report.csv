strong background in AI/ML solution design and deployment; proven ability to deliver end‑to‑end cloud‑based AI projects (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, tuning); deep expertise with AWS cloud services (Lambda, EC2, EKS, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.) matching the JD’s cloud‑platform requirement; solid DevOps/MLOps skill set (CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, automated testing, security scanning) supporting rapid project delivery; incident‑management and root‑cause analysis experience aligning with the JD’s service/incident management expectations; leadership of cross‑functional teams and mentorship experience; familiarity with monitoring tools (Datadog, New Relic, Site24*7) that complement AI solution observability.","No explicit experience with Text Mining or NLP-specific projects and open‑source NLP toolkits; lack of Hadoop/Map‑Reduce or other Big‑Data processing experience; no mention of Azure OpenAI, LangChain, or other Azure GenAI services; no stated experience with Agentic AI architecture or prompt‑engineering details; not familiar with Rasa or other chatbot frameworks; missing deep‑learning framework experience (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Theano); no listed SQL or Java programming skills; no clear evidence of statistical‑methods expertise or formal certifications in AI/ML/GenAI;

Python proficiency is implied but not explicitly stated, and Java skills (a plus in JD) are not mentioned. | No reference to experience with service/incident management tools such as JIRA or ServiceNow, which are listed under “Hands‑On with Service / Incident Management tools.”"
